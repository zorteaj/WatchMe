Steps to run:

1. `pip install -r requirements.txt`* 
2. `python main.py`
3. Follow instructions on screen to switch between optical flow and facial recognition

*This should work in theory, but in practice, I could only get Panda3D working (its 'direct' dependecy seemed to be the issue) by installing it from https://www.panda3d.org/download/ and adding the following to my PATH env var:

C:\Panda3D-1.10.3-x64\python
C:\Panda3D-1.10.3-x64\python\Scripts
C:\Panda3D-1.10.3-x64\bin
